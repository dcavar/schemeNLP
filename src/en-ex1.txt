PM: Iraq to Get Legal Custody of Hussein
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Iraq's Prime Minister Iyad Allawi declared that Saddam Hussein will be transferred to Iraqi legal custody on Wednesday and face charges before an Iraqi court the following day.
In his first news conference after the transfer of sovereignty, Allawi promised an open proceeding when Saddam faces war crimes charges, including genocide. Eleven others ``high-value detainees'' also are expected to face justice.
``We would like to show the world that the new Iraq government means business and wants to do business and wants to stabilize Iraq and put it on the road toward democracy and peace,'' Allawi said. ``We want to put this bad history behind us and move toward a spirit of national unity and reconciliation in the future.''
Saddam will remain in a U.S.-run jail because the Iraqi government lacks a suitable prison.
The trials for Saddam and 11 others will not occur for months and he urged the Iraqi people to be patient. Even so, he acknowledged that more than 1 million Iraqis are missing as a result of events that occurred during the former regime.
Allawi said the Iraqi Cabinet still discussing whether to reinstate the death penalty.
Justice Minister Malik Dohan al-Hassan said Saddam could have foreign lawyer - if Iraqi lawyers' association agrees.
